# Tech Health Analysis

## Motivation
How do you discuss tech health in your team? How do you do so in an objective way that supports prioritisation?  
And how do you raise awareness on an organisational level?  

## Template
This is a simple template that aims to help on that topic. It consists of 2 parts:  
- A service assessment part.
- An aggregated view of the services' assessments in an organisation.

The service assessment part is supposed to be a self-assessment from the team that owns it. They will discuss a few tech health aspects of their service and give them a rating. One recommendation here is to have a "perfect service" assessed as reference, to both help guide the team during their discussions and to provide some level of consistency in how teams are working with these aspects. Consider bringing in an experienced engineer or manager to further facilitate these discussions and questions the team might have.

The aggregated view part should be straightforward, and show the different teams' assessments together. It can help get a feel for the overall picture, and highlight patterns.  

You don't need to do it for all your services, as it can be too much work. Focus on what you believe are your most important ones.
